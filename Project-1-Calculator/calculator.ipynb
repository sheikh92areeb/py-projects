    "### **Simple Calculator (Version 1.0)**\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "A simple calculator allowing users to perform a single calculation with basic arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /.\n",
    "#### Features:\n",
    "1.  Prompts the user for two numbers and an operator.\n",
    "2.  Performs one of the operations based on the chosen operator.\n",
    "3.  Displays the result.\n",
    "4.  Handles invalid operators with a generic error message.\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "-   Only supports integer inputs.\n",
    "-   Does not handle division by zero.\n",
    "-   Only allows a single operation per program execution."

    "#### Description:\n",
    "Introduces a modular design with a function to handle calculations and incorporates enhanced features for better usability and robustness.\n",
    "#### Features:\n",
    "1.  Supports both integers and decimal inputs.\n",
    "2.  Adds a dedicated calculation function for code reusability and readability.\n",
    "3.  Automatically converts whole-number results to integers for cleaner display (e.g., 8.0 becomes 8).\n",
    "4.  Improves user prompts for better clarity.\n",
    "5.  Validates user input for operations and ensures input consistency.\n",
    "6.  Handles division by zero gracefully with an error message.\n",
    "7.  Provides a cleaner exit process with user-friendly messages.\n",
    "#### Enhancements Implemented:\n",
    "-   Modularization with the calculation function.\n",
    "-   Input validation and error handling for invalid numbers.\n",
    "-   Automatic formatting of results based on value type (integer or float).\n",
